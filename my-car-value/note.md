# Entity Files

- An entity is very similar to a model in just about any other framework or language.
- An entity file, defines a single kind of resource or a single kind of thing that we want to store inside our application.
- List all properties, that it suppose to have.
- After create entity files, we're going to feed them into Nest. Nest and TypeORM will work together to create a _repository_ for us.
